# File: user_run_SDM.r
# Purpose: Run a full SDM model, or pickup an existing run executed using run_SDM.
# After running a full model, save this file in the species' 'loc_scripts' folder

# Step 1: Download updated scripts from GitHub repository
# Usage: to put the latest modeling scripts in a new folder created in 'loc_scripts' (set below),
# which are used for new modeling runs

# set project folder and species code for this run
project_folder <- "D:/SDM/Tobacco"
model_species <- "bombaffi"

# path where you want to save model run scripts
loc_scripts <- paste0(project_folder, "/inputs/species/", model_species ,"/scripts")
# github branch to download
branch <- "master"

# this downloads latest scripts from GitHub (you can save this 'get_scripts.R' 
# file anywhere on your computer, so you don't have to change the path)
source("E:/git/Regional_SDM/helper/get_scripts.R", local = TRUE)
# NOTE any messages, and download/place scripts manually if necessary

# manually set loc_scripts path here if get_scripts fails
loc_scripts <- script_store
loc_scripts <- "E:/git/Regional_SDM"

# remove everything but necessary variables
rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE)[!ls(all.names = TRUE) %in% c("project_folder","model_species","loc_scripts")])

# set wd and load function
setwd(loc_scripts)
source("helper/run_SDM.R")

##############
# End step 1 #
##############

# Step 2: execute a new model
# Usage: For a full, new model run, provide all paths/file names to arguments 'loc_scripts' THROUGH 'modeller'.

# Optional arguments for all runs include:
# 1. begin_step: specify as the prefix of the step to begin with: one of ("1","2","3","4","4b","4c","5").
#     Defaults to "1", so not necessary to specify for new runs.
# 2. prompt: if TRUE, the function will stop after each script, and ask if you want to continue. 
#     Defaults to FALSE.
# 3. add_vars: variables that are not part of the standard set for this species, which you wish to 
#     include in the model run.
# 4. remove_vars: variables that are part of the standard set for this species, which you wish to
#     remove from the model run.

# RUN A NEW MODEL (ALL STEPS 1-5)
# If picking up from a previous run (after step 1), use Step 2-alt below
# update the function arguments below as necessary, and run the function
